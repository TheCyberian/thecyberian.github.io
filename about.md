I am a SDET with a comprehensive range of skill sets, including **full stack web application development**, **android application development**, **Automation Testing** and **Web App Penetration testing**. I can develop and build secure solutions designed to attract your targeted customers.

As a developer, I can design and develop mobile tools that allow you to tap into an accessible method for communicating to your audience.

*As a tester, I can test the application rigorously for software vulnerabilities, which if left unchecked, can be exploited by hackers.*

I take additonal steps to have a clearer understanding of what steps should be taken to ensure your specific product needs are entirely met. My goal is not just to get the project completed, I will work with you, tracking marketing effectiveness and making adjustments to the product if needed to bring you closer to your goals.
